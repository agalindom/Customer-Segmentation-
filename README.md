# Overview
The notebook contains code for the final capstone project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

# Description
In order to complete the project two tasks must be achieved:
  1. From the general population, and using unsupervised learning techniques, find the group that contains characteristics of the individuals that have the most probability of being new customers for Arvato Financial Services.
  2. Using supervised learning, and using a labeled dataset, train a model that learns to distinguish individuals that are potential customers to the ones that are not.

The results of the second task are submitted to an inclass kaggle competition
